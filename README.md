# lofi-cli
Simple CLI that plays ChilledCow's lofi hip-hop [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ) directly to your terminal.

## Why?
If you're a student then you're likely listening to the ChilledCow lofi livesteam on YouTube while you study. 

However, performance becomes an issue, especially if you have multiple browser tabs or programs running on your computer, because a lot of resources are allocated to other features involved with the browser. 

lofi-cli simply streams only the audio from the livestream, and pipes it to your machine's output.
